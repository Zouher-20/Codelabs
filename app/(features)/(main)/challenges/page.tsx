        description: "It's the final week of the Notifications challenge!Last week, we gave some love to the most unloveable type of notifications: error messages. Check out the Pens from week three in our #CodePenChallenge: Error Messages collection. This week, we'll gather up all kinds of notifications into one convenient place with a Notification Center üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Our starter template includes a simple social notification center that opens & closes to reveal the notifications. It's not very stylish or user-friendly ‚Äî yet. That's your challenge!We'll have lots of ideas and resources to help you tackle this challenge. And, as always, the template is just a starting point. Feel free to add or remove elements, change the content, or dismiss the whole thing and start over from scratch.",
        resources: "Gather style inspiration for your notification center from Juxtopposed's Futuristic Social Media, Chris Bolson's well-rounded Notifications and Messages, or Vaibhav Khulbe's iOS 15 Notification Summary. And of course, you can find a ton of style concepts for a project like this under Dribbble's notification center tag. While you planning out the open & close of your notification center, take a little time to browse through some community inspiration! Check out the elegantly brisk open & close animation in Ward Larson's Activity notification panel concept, and the slide-out card controls on Sabine Robart's Sliding Notifications Card, and the classic style of sean_codes' Notifications Menu. Want to add some interactivity to your message center? Peruse Takane Ichinose's Reaction Social Media Card, Chris Coyier's Vue Neverending Inbox, Piotr Galor's cheeky Thanks for notifications, and Pieter Biesemans' Notifications UI + filtering for ideas."
